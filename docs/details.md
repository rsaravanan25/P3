# Details for P3 DNA/LinkStrand

Many parts of the assignment, including workflow and the classes you use and write, are part of this document.

## Starter Code and Using Git
**_You should have installed all software (Java, Git, VS Code) before completing this project._** You can find the [directions for installation here](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201fall23/resources-201/-/blob/main/installingSoftware.md) (including workarounds for submitting without Git if needed).

We'll be using Git and the installation of GitLab at [coursework.cs.duke.edu](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu). All code for classwork will be kept here. Git is software used for version control, and GitLab is an online repository to store code in the cloud using Git.

**[This document details the workflow](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/201fall23/resources-201/-/blob/main/projectWorkflow.md) for downloading the starter code for the project, updating your code on coursework using Git, and ultimately submitting to Gradescope for autograding.** We recommend that you read and follow the directions carefully this first time working on a project! While coding, we recommend that you periodically (perhaps when completing a method or small section) push your changes as explained in below.

## DNA strands and the Starter Code

For the purposes of this project, DNA is represented as a sequence of characters, specifically `a`, `c`, `g`, and `t` for the four chemical bases of DNA. There can be a *lot* of these bases in a DNA sequence, so efficiency matters when dealing with DNA data computationally. This project includes a `data/` folder containing two data files: `ecoli.txt` and `ecoli_small.txt`, which represent the genetic information of ecoli - there are over 4.6 million bases in the full sequence in `ecoli.txt` and over 320 thousand in the `ecoli_small.txt` subsequence.

To get started you should read the comments in the `IDnaStrand` interface to understand what functionality implementations of that interface should provide with respect to manipulating DNA data. You will note that some methods in the interface have a `default` implementation provided, but most do not -- these are the methods you will be implementing. The `default` method `cutAndSplice` is the one that is benchmarked by the code provided in `DNABenchmark`, see [Part 1](#part-1-running-dnabenchmark-profiling-analysis) for a discussion of that method and its complexity.

Two relatively straightforward implementations of the `IDnaStrand` interface are provided in the starter code. `StringStrand` represents a DNA sequence as a simple String. `StringBuilderStrand` represents a DNA sequence as a  [`StringBuilder`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html). You can look at these two classese to see simple and correct (but not necessarily efficient) implementations of the functionality specified in the `IDnaStrand` interface.

## Complexity of cutAndSplice

The method `cutAndSplice` is not a mutator. It starts with a strand of DNA and creates a new strand by finding each and every occurrence of a restriction enzyme like `“gaattc”` and replacing this enzyme by a specified splicee -- another strand of DNA. If `dna` represents the strand `"cgatcctagatcgg"` then the call 

```java
dna.cutAndSplice("gat", "gggtttaaa")
```

would result in returning a new strand of DNA in which each occurrence of `"gat"` in `dna` is replaced by `"gggtttaaa"` -- as shown in the diagram below where the original strand is shown first, with the enzyme `"gat"` shaded in blue and the splicee `"gggtttaaa"` shaded in green. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/splice.png">
</div>

```


```

The diagram illustrates how `cutAndSplice` works with both `StringStrand` and `StringBuilderStrand`. Each is a strand of 14 characters in which the restriction enzyme `"gat"` occurs twice, is replaced by `"gggtttaaa"`, resulting in creating and returning a new strand that contains 26 characters.

Note that if the original strand has size N, then the new strand has size N + b(S-E) where b is the number of breaks, or occurrences of the enzyme, S is the length of the splicee and E is the length of the enzyme. If we assume the splicee is large, as it will be when benchmarking, we can ignore E and this becomes approximately N + bS, the size of the recombinant new strand in terms. 

The runtime and memory complexity for `cutAndSplice` can be expressed as a function of N, b, and S. The complexity also depends on the implementation used for the `IDnaStrand` interface. Of particular importance for the runtime complexity is the efficiency of the `append` method, which you will note is called repeatedly by `cutAndSplice`. For the memory complexity, the question is how the implementation represents the resulting recombinant Strand.

## Part 1 Running DNABenchmark

You select which implementation to use changing the value of the static instance variable `strandType` at the top of the class file. Note that the `StringStrand` class may take several seconds to run on `ecoli_small.txt`. `StringBuilderStrand` can scale to `ecoli.txt`, but you may not want to run `StringStrand` on the larger data set as it may take several minutes to run.

The main method benchmarks the average time (over several trials)  in milliseconds that it takes to run `cutAndSplice` for different values of N (the size of the original dna strand), b (the number of breaks / occurrences of the `enzyme`), and S (the size of the `splicee`). It also shows the size of the resulting recombininant new Strand, labeled as `recomb`, which is roughly equal to N + bS. 

First it performs several runs increasing S while holding the other values constant. Then it performs several runs increasing N and b while holding S constant. Example runs from an instructor's computer on `ecoli_small.txt` are shown below (note that your timings may differ but should show similar trends).

## Part 2: Programming LinkStrand

You need to implement two constructors as described below.
The constructors and methods don't need to be implemented in the order shown there, but the simpler methods are listed first. These methods are tested in the `TestStrand` class.

### 1. `LinkStrand` State, Constructors and `initialize` Method
Implement two constructors: one with no parameters (the default constructor) and one with a `String` parameter. The constructors work by calling the required initialize method. Refer to `StringStrand.java` for an example to adapt. Implement the initialize method that initializes the `LinkStrand` object with a `String`.

#### Details on LinkStrand State, Constructors and initialize Method

You should start by defining a `private` inner `Node` class (that is, defined inside of the `LinkStrand` class) that defines a node in the `LinkStrand`. Each such node should store at least a `String` (referred to as `info` in this writeup) and a reference to the next node in the list. You will also need to define a constructor for your inner class.

After you have defined your node class, you should use the following instance variables definitions for the `ListStrand` class.

```java
private Node myFirst, myLast;
private long mySize;
private int myAppends;
private int myIndex;
private Node myCurrent;
private int myLocalIndex;
```

**All constructors and methods must maintain the following class invariants:**
1. `myFirst` references the first node in a linked list of nodes.
2. `myLast` references the last node in a linked list of nodes.
3. `mySize` represents the total number of characters stored in all nodes together.
4. `myAppends` is the number of times that the append method has been called. It would be useful to think of this as one less than the number of nodes in the linked list.

The following instance variables will be updated in `charAt()`:
1. `myIndex` tracks the last character we accessed with the `charAt()` method. Initialize this as `0`.
2. `myCurrent` tracks the last node holding the character at position `myIndex`. Initialize this as `myFirst`.
3. `myLocalIndex` tracks the last character we accessed within the `Node`. Initialize `this` as `0`.

Initially, when the `LinkStrand("cgatt...")` constructor is called  (though the `String` parameter can be any string) there will be a single node in the linked list that represents the DNA strand `"cgatt…"`. (The only way to have more than one node in a `LinkStrand` internal linked-list is by calling `.append`.)

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/initialize.png">
</div>

As described above, you'll create two constructors. The string constructor should consist of one call to initialize which establishes the class invariant with a single node representing the entire strand of DNA as illustrated. The no-argument constructor, also called the default constructor, should have one line: `this("")`  --- this calls the one-parameter constructor with a String parameter of `""`. 

The `initialize` method will initialize instance variables and maintain the class invariants when it's called. Create a one-node list
in `initialize` and make sure that both `myFirst` and `myLast` reference/point to this Node. That will ensure part of the class invariant
is true.

### 2. Implementing the `getInstance` and `size` Methods
Implement the `getInstance` method that works similarly to what you see in `StringStrand` and `StringBuilder` strand. This must return a `LinkStrand` object. 

Implement `size`. This should return `mySize` which ensures it runs in O(1) time. You'll maintain `mySize` as one of the class invariants.

### 3. Implementing the `append` and `getAppendCount` Methods 
Implement `append` which creates one new node and updates instance variables to maintain class invariants as described in the details below. Implement `getAppendCount`. This should be a single line and must run in `O(1)` time.

#### Details on Implementing the append and getAppendCount Methods

The `append` method should add one new node to the end of the internal linked list and update state to maintain the invariant. For example, suppose that these two statements are both executed:

```java
LinkStrand dna = new LinkStrand("cgatt");
dna.append("aattcc");
```

The internal linked list maintained by `LinkStrand` after the first call consists of a single
node. After the call to append we have the following diagram:

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/append.png">
</div>


Note that maintaining the class invariant after this call to append would require:
1. `myFirst` doesn't change
2. `myLast` changes to point to the new node added
3. `mySize` is incremented by six
4. `myAppends` is incremented by one (because a new node is added).

Note that `.append` returns an `IDnaStrand` object. This is the object that was just modified/appended to. However, the method append does not create a new `IDnaStrand` object. The `.append` method is a mutator -- it changes the internal state of the `IDnaStrand` object on which it's invoked, and then returns this `LinkStrand` object itself. Look carefully at both `StringStrand` and `StringBuilderStand` strand to see what to return.

Note that after implementing `append`, the method `getAppendCount` should return the correct result, the value of instance variable `myAppends` that's maintained by the class invariants and initialized/updated in `initialize` and `append`.



### 4. Implementing the `toString` Method
Implement `toString`. This returns the `String` representation of the `LinkStrand` by looping over nodes and appending their values to a `StringBuilder` object. The method should run in `O(N)` time for a stand with `N` nucleotides.

#### Details on Implementing the toString Method

The `toString` method returns the `String` representation of the entire DNA strand. Conceptually this is a concatenation of the `String` values stored in each node.

This method should use a standard `while` loop to visit each node in the internal linked list. The method creates and updates a single `StringBuilder` object by appending each `node.info` field to a `StringBuilder` object that's initially empty. The final return from `LinkStrand.toString` will simply be returning the result of calling `.toString()` on the `StringBuilder` object.

For more guidance on `StringBuilder`, see the [Java Documentation here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html). 

You should be able to test all the methods implemented to this point using the class `TestStrand`. The testing methods in `TestStrand` rely on `.toString` being correct, so after implementing `.toString` you may find errors in your other methods as a result of testing.

### 5. Implementing the `reverse` Method
Implement `reverse` to return a new `LinkStrand` object that's the reverse of the object on which it's called. **This method is not a mutator, it creates a new `LinkStrand`.**

#### Details on Implementing the reverse Method

This method creates a new `LinkStrand` object that is the reverse of the object on which it's called. The reverse of `"cgatccgg"` is `"ggcctagc"`. This method returns a new strand; **it does not alter the strand on which it's called**, i.e., it's not a mutator. 

You should create a new linked list with nodes in reverse order, and each string in each node also reversed. Put differently: The reversed `LinkStrand` you return should have the same number of nodes as the original `LinkStrand`, but in reverse order; each internal node should also contain the reversed `String` of the corresponding node in the original `LinkStrand`. 

For example, if the original `LinkStrand` looks like
<div align="center">
  <img width=300 src="figures/beforeReverse.png">
</div>
then the `LinkStrand` returned by `reverse` should look like the following:
<div align="center">
  <img width=300 src="figures/afterReverse.png">
</div>
with no changes to the original.

The easiest way (and an efficient way) to reverse a `String` in Java is to use [`StringBuilder` and the `reverse` method](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html#reverse()).

Be sure to update all instance variables of the new reversed `LinkStrand` you are creating to be correct before it is returned. You may need to do this
directly by assigning values to the instance variables of the new `LinkStrand` object.

### Implementing the `charAt` Method
Implement `charAt` which returns the character at a specific index. This method requires new instance variables *to meet performance characteristics.*

#### Details on Implementing the charAt Method

This method returns the character at the specified index if that's a valid index, and throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` otherwise. A naive implementation of this method would start at the beginning of the linked list, the node referenced by `myFirst` and count characters until the `index`-th character is found. Note that you will need to loop *both* through the nodes, *and* through the characters within each node. 

For full credit, your `charAt` method should be more efficient. Specifically, you should maintain *state* (in this case, storing information in instance variables) so that after a call of `charAt(k)` the call of `charAt(k+1)` is a constant time operation.

To do this, you should appropriately update the following  instance variables: one for the current node in a sequence of calls of `charAt`, one for the current index into that node, and one for the overall count; these are explained below. 

- `myIndex` is the value of the parameter in the last call to `charAt`. This means that if a call to `s.charAt(100)` is followed by `s.charAt(101)` the value of `myIndex` will be 100 after `s.charAt(100)` executes and `myIndex` will be 101 after `s.charAt(101)` executes.
- `myLocalIndex` is the value of the index *within the string stored in the node last-referenced* by `charAt` when the method finishes. For example, suppose a strand consists of three nodes: the first has 60 characters; followed by a node of 30 characters; followed by a node of 40 characters. The call `s.charAt(40)` will mean that `myIndex` is 40 and `myLocalIndex` is also 40 since that's the index within the first node of the list, where the character whose index is 40 is found.  Suppose this is followed by `s.charAt(70).` The character at index 60 of the entire strand will be the character with index zero of the second node -- since the first node holds characters with indexes 0-59 since its info field is a string of 60 characters. The character at index 70 of the entire strand will be the character with index 10 of the second node. This means that after the call `charAt(70)` the value of `myIndex` will be 70, the value of `myLocalIndex` will be 10, and the value of `myCurrent` (see just below) is a pointer to the second node of a three-node list.

<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/charAt.png">
</div>

- `myCurrent` is the node of the internal list referenced in the last call to `charAt`. In the example above the value of `myCurrent` would be the first node after the call `s.charAt(40)`, would be the second node after the call `s.charAt(70)` or `s.charAt(89)`, and would be the third node after the call `s.charAt(90)` since the first two nodes only contain a total of 90 characters, with indexes 0 to 89.


### Why do we need charAt to be efficient?
If the `charAt` method is not efficient, the loop below will be `O(N^2)` since the `charAt` method will be `O(k)` to access the kth character.

```java
LinkStrand dna = new LinkStrand(".....");
StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("");
for(int k=0; k < dna.size(); k++) {
    s.append(dna.charAt(k));
}
```

This `charAt` method is called by the code in the `CharDnaIterator` class. So iterating over an `IDnaStrand` object will ultimately use the `charAt` method as shown in the code below. 

```java
LinkStrand dna = new LinkStrand(".....");
Iterator<Character> iter= dna.iterator();
for(char ch : iter) {
    System.out.print(ch);
}
System.out.println();
```

The `Iterator` object in the code above is constructed as a result of calling the default `IDnaStrand.iterator` method, the body is shown here: 

```java
return new CharDnaIterator(this);
```

Note that the `IDnaStrand` object referenced by `this` is then stored in the `CharDnaIterator` object being created. 

You only need to implement `charAt`, then *all the code described and shown above will work correctly!* You will need to initialize the instance variables too.

### Order of Calls Matters
However, *you'll need to write code to deal with calls that aren't "in order".* If the call `.charAt(100)` is followed by the call `.charAt(30)` you'll need to start at the beginning of the internal linked list to find the character with index 30. If `.charAt(100)` is followed by `.charAt(350)` you won't start at the first node, but continue with the values stored in the instance variables.

## Complexity of LinkStrand method `cutAndSplice`

 Complexity of cutAndSplice with LinkStrand

In an earlier example, if `dna` represents the strand `"cgatcctagatcgg"` then the call 

```java
dna.cutAndSplice("gat", "gggtttaaa")
```

would result in returning a new strand of DNA in which each occurrence of the enzyme/strand `"gat"` in the object `dna` is replaced by the splice, `"gggtttaaa"`. 

For this example, the `LinkStrand` result is diagrammed below.

<div align="center">
  <img width="600" src="figures/link-cutsplice.png">
</div>

Each time the original strand, a single string, is cut/spliced a new node is created. The new nodes for the `splicee` can all have `String info` referencing the same `String` object in memory, as shown in the diagram for the second and fourth nodes. These represent the first and second occurrences of `"gat"`, respectively. Note that this means `LinkStrand` only needs to represent the `splicee` string once, however many times it is being spliced in / however many breaks there are.

This diagram represents the final `LinkStrand` object after a cut-and-splice operation. That strand is created by the `default cutAndSplice` implementation that calls `toString`, `getInstance`, and `append` which in `LinkStrand` ultimately result in a sequence of nodes as shown here --- mostly because of how `append` works.
